/**
 * Description:
 * This example demonstrates how to interface the RAM of a DS1307 RTC module.
 * DS1307 RTC has a 56 Byte RAM. Its address space starts at 0x08 and ends at 0x3F.
 * This RAM space is excellent in cases where you want to store data safely
 * (that persist through power downs). You could use it in your project that
 * involves the RTC to avoid having to buy an SD shield and saving the those 
 * data on an SD card.
 * 
 * This example initially writes a string on the RTC's RAM and defines a variable 
 * COUNTER that is saved on the module's RAM too. Then, at every iteration of 
 * loop, it reads the variable COUNTER and the module's RAM altogether and then 
 * prints on the serial monitor the variable along with the string that is
 * contained in the module's RAM space.
 * 
 * Note:
 * The buffers of the Wire library, either for sending or receiving data, are
 * 32 bytes long. So, for example in the case of the DS1307, we can't read the 
 * whole RAM in one step. We'll have to read the first half first and the 
 * second half later.
